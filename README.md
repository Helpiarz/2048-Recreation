# 2048 - Game Recreation

Classic 2048 game built as a portfolio project using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript (currently non-functional).

## How To Play
[PLAY THE GAME](https://helpiarz.github.io/2048/)

The objective of the game is to combine tiles with the same numbers until you reach 2048 (or higher).

*Controls and Rules*:
- **Arrow keys or WSAD**: move all tiles in the chosen direction
- **Combine Tiles**: when two tiles of the same number touch, they merge into anew tile with the sum of their values
- **Score**: by merging two tiles, the value of the new tile is added to the score
- **Game Over**: the game ends when it's impossible to move tile in any direction

## Inspiration
This project is personal recreation of the original 2048 game. The original concept and gameplay were developed by Gabriele Cirulli. The implementation and all code are written by me.
